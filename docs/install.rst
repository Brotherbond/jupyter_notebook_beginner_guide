Installation
============

Step 0: The browser
-------------------

The step "zero" is installing a modern standard-compliant browser. Either
Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome will work well. Please try to avoid
MS Explorer.

Step 1: Installation
--------------------

The easiest way to install the *Jupyter Notebook App* is
installing a scientific python distribution that bundles it.
In this guide we will use the Anaconda distribution created by Continuum.
Note that Anaconda currently (mid 2015) still uses the old name
*IPython Notebook* instead of *Jupyter Notebook App* but the software is the same.

- Download `Continuum Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_
  (free version), python 2.7, 64 bits.

- Install it using the default settings for a single user.
