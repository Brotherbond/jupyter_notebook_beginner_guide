Jupyter/IPython Notebook Quick Start Guide
==========================================

This document is a brief step-by-step tutorial on installing and running
Jupyter (IPython) notebooks on local computer for new users who have no familiarity with python.

Briefly, if someone gave you a notebook to run and you don't know what
a notebook is, this document is for you.

**Jupyter Notebook App** (formerly **IPython Notebook**) is 
an application running inside the browser.
This guide describes how to install and use *Jupyter Notebook App* 
as normal desktop application, without using any remote server.

For other use-cases, please refer to the `Official Jupyter Documentation <http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/>`__.
