What is Jupyter Notebook
========================

Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython) is an application that runs inside your
browser.
For our purposes, Jupyter Notebook is run locally like a normal desktop
application and does not require accessing any remote server.

What we call the "notebooks" are text documents
produced by the Jupyter Notebook application that contains both code and
and rich text (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etc...).
Notebooks are both human-readable documents containing the analysis
description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) and executable documents
that can be run to perform a data analysis.
