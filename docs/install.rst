Installation
============

Step 0: The browser
-------------------

Step "zero" consists in installing a modern standard-compliant browser. Either
Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome will work well. Try to avoid
MS Explorer.

Step 1: Installation
--------------------

The easiest way to install the *Jupyter Notebook App* consists in
installing a scientific python distribution which includes it.
In this guide, we will use the Anaconda distribution created by Continuum.
Note that Anaconda currently (mid 2015) still uses the old name
*IPython Notebook* instead of *Jupyter Notebook App* but the software is the same.

- Download `Continuum Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_
  (free version, approx. 300MB), python 3, 64 bits.

- Install it using the default settings for a single user.

....

The *Next* button will bring you to the next section (*Running Jupyter Notebook*).
