Installation
============

Step 0: The browser
-------------------

Step "zero" consists in installing a modern standard-compliant browser. Either
Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome will work well. Try to avoid
MS Explorer.

Step 1: Installation
--------------------

The easiest way to install the *Jupyter Notebook App* is
installing a scientific python distribution which also includes 
scientific python packages. The most common distribution is called **Anaconda**:

- Download `Anaconda Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_
  (a few 100MB), Python 3, 64 bits.

- Install it using the default settings for a *single user*.

*Official docs:* `Installation: If you are new to Python and Jupyter <https://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#new-to-python-and-jupyter>`__.

....

The *Next* button will bring you to the next section (*Running Jupyter Notebook*).
